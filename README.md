If you want to run the program for the first time, I suggets running the "Make SoundShift Database.py" file first, to make sure that the database it set up properly

If you want to test the program, the five sets of credentials are:
Username, Password:
1. johndoe, password
2. janesmith, password1
3. alicejohnson, password2
4. bobbrown, password3
5. charliegreen, admin
